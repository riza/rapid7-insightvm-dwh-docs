# Table: `dim_asset_vulnerability_finding_solution`

**Description:**  Dimension that provides access to what solutions can be used to remediate a vulnerability on an asset. The solution(s) presented for an asset and vulnerability will be matched on the metadata/fingerprints of the asset. If a single solution cannot be selected based on the fingerprints of an asset, multiple solutions may be selected and presented. The solution(s) provided represent only the most direct/immediate solutions associated with the vulnerability. See  dim_asset_vulnerability_finding_rollup_solution for similar information, but with rollups and supercedence applied.
