# Table: `fact_asset_vulnerability_finding_date`

**Description:** Periodic snapshot fact for vulnerability findings on an asset. This fact table is a date-based snapshot of the fact_asset_vulnerability_finding table. During each export process, the current data is appended to this fact table.


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `day` | `date` | The date the snapshot was recorded. |
| `asset_id` | `bigint` | The unique identifier of the asset. |
| `vulnerability_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the vulnerability. |
| `date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability was first found on the asset. This is the earliest date any instance on the asset was found. |
| `critical_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` | The number of critical vulnerabilities this finding represents. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is critical, 0 otherwise. |
| `severe_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` |  The number of severe vulnerabilities this finding represents. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is severe, 0 otherwise. |
| `moderate_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` | The number of moderate vulnerabilities this finding represents. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is moderate, 0 otherwise. |
| `malware_kits` | `integer` | The the count of malware kits associated to the vulnerability. |
| `exploits` | `integer` | The the count of exploits associated to the vulnerability. |
| `vulnerabilities_with_malware_kit` | `integer` | The number of vulnerabilities this finding represents that have malware kits. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding has malware_kits, 0 otherwise. |
| `vulnerabilities_with_exploit` | `integer` | The number of vulnerabilities this finding represents that have exploits. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding has exploits, 0 otherwise. |
| `vulnerability_instances` | `bigint` | The number of instances of this finding on the asset. |
| `raw_risk_score` | `double precision` | The raw risk score for the vulnerability of this finding. |
| `risk_score` | `double precision` | The risk score for the vulnerability of this finding. |
| `pci_failures` | `bigint` | The number of PCI failures for the vulnerability. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is would caused a PCI failure, 0 otherwise. |
| `validated` | `boolean` | Whether the vulnerability has been validated (e.g. using Metasploit). |
| `reintroduced_date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability was first reintroduced on the asset following a previous remediation |
