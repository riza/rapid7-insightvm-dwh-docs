# Table: `dim_asset_vulnerability_finding_rollup_solution`

**Description:** Dimension that provides access to what "best" solutions can be used to remediate a vulnerability on an asset. The solution(s) presented for an asset and vulnerability will be matched on the metadata/fingerprints of the asset and take supercedence and rollup into account. Despite this, multiple solutions may be selected and presented if a single solution cannot be selected. See dim_asset_vulnerability_finding_solution to gain access to the solutions without rollup applied.


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |

| `vulnerability_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the vulnerability. |
| `solution_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the rollup solution. |
