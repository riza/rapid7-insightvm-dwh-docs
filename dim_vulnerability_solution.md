# Table: `dim_vulnerability_solution`

**Description:** Dimension that provides access to the relationship between a vulnerability and its (direct) solutions. These solutions are only those which are directly known to remediate the vulnerability, and do not include rollups or superceding solutions. If a vulnerability has more than one solution (e.g. for multiple platforms), multiple association records will be present. If a vulnerability has no known solutions, it will have no records in this  dimension.
