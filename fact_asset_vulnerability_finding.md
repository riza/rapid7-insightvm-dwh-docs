# Table: `fact_asset_vulnerability_finding`

**Description:** Accumulating snapshot fact for all current vulnerability findings on an asset. This fact is a convenience rollup for the fact_asset_vulnerability_instance fact and provides a record for each vulnerability finding on every asset. If an asset was not vulnerable to any vulnerabilities (or all instances are excluded), it will have no records in this fact table. If multiple instances of a vulnerability are found on the same asset they will be aggregated together in the instances count. This fact table should be the preferred level of grain when instance-level details (such as the port and proof) are not required. To access exploitability information for the finding refer to fact_asset_vulnerability_finding_exploit. 


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `asset_id` | `bigint` | The unique identifier of the asset. |
| `vulnerability_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the vulnerability. |
| `date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability was first found on the asset. This is the earliest date any instance on the asset was found. |
| `critical_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` | The number of critical vulnerabilities this finding represents. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is critical, 0 otherwise. |
| `severe_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` |  The number of severe vulnerabilities this finding represents. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is severe, 0 otherwise. |
| `moderate_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` | The number of moderate vulnerabilities this finding represents. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is moderate, 0 otherwise. |
| `malware_kits` | `integer` | The the count of malware kits associated to the vulnerability. |
| `exploits` | `integer` | The the count of exploits associated to the vulnerability. |
| `vulnerabilities_with_malware_kit` | `integer` | The number of vulnerabilities this finding represents that have malware kits. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding has malware_kits, 0 otherwise. |
| `vulnerabilities_with_exploit` | `integer` | The number of vulnerabilities this finding represents that have exploits. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding has exploits, 0 otherwise. |
| `vulnerability_instances` | `bigint` | The number of instances of this finding on the asset. |
| `raw_risk_score` | `double precision` | The raw risk score for the vulnerability of this finding. |
| `risk_score` | `double precision` | The risk score for the vulnerability of this finding. |
| `pci_failures` | `bigint` | The number of PCI failures for the vulnerability. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is would caused a PCI failure, 0 otherwise. |
| `validated` | `boolean` | Whether the vulnerability has been validated (e.g. using Metasploit). |
| `reintroduced_date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability was first reintroduced on the asset following a previous remediation |
