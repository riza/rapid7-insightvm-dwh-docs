# Table: `fact_vulnerability`

**Description:** Accumulating snapshot fact for a vulnerability. This convenience fact rolls up assets by the vulnerabilities they are vulnerable to. Each row represents one distinct vulnerability and the results for that vulnerability. If no assets are vulnerable to a vulnerability there will still be a record in this fact table. There will always be one row in this fact table for every vulnerability defined in the dim_vulnerability dimension.
