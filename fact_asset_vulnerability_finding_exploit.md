# Table: `fact_asset_vulnerability_finding_exploit`

**Description:** Accumulating snapshot fact for all current vulnerability findings on an asset that are known to be exploitable. This fact is a convenience rollup for the fact_asset_vulnerability_instance fact and provides a record for each vulnerability finding on every asset that is exploitable. If an asset was not vulnerable to an exploitable vulnerability (or all instances are excluded), it will have no records in this fact table. Each row represents one unique exploit, and either the malware_kit_id or exploit_id is guaranteed to be non-null. This fact table should be the preferred level of grain when instance-level details (such as the port and proof) are not required. 


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `asset_id` | `bigint` | The unique identifier of the asset. |
| `vulnerability_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the vulnerability. |
| `exploit_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the exploit. |
| `malware_kit_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the malware_kit_id. |
