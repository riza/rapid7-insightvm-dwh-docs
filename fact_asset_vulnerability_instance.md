# Table: `fact_asset_vulnerability_instance`

**Description:** Accumulating snapshot fact for all current vulnerability instances on an asset. This fact provides a record for each vulnerability instance on every asset. If an asset is not vulnerable to any vulnerabilities (or all vulnerabilities have been excluded) it will have no records in this fact table.


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `asset_id` | `bigint` | The unique identifier of the asset. |
| `vulnerability_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the vulnerability. |
| `date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability instance was first found on the asset. |
| `status` | `text` | The status of the vulnerability, one of the values: 'Confirmed vulnerability', 'Vulnerable version', 'Potential vulnerability' |
| `proof` | `text` | Free-form text that describes the proof which explains why the vulnerability is present on the asset. The proof is represented using HTML markup that can be "flattened" using the htmlToText() function. |
| `key` | `text` | Optional secondary identifier for a vulnerability result that can distinguish the result from other vulnerability instances of the same type on the system, but found in different locations (e.g. URLs). |
| `service` | `text` | The service this vulnerability test was performed against. If the vulnerability was detected without a network-based service, the value will be NULL. |
| `port` | `integer` | The port on which the service was running if the vulnerability was found through a network service. If the vulnerability was not found in the network service, the value is NULL. The data within this column will only contain valid port numbers (0 - 65535). |
| `protocol` | `text` | The protocol that the service was using on which the vulnerability was found. If the vulnerability was not found on a network service, the value is NULL. |
| `reintroduced_date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability instance was first reintroduced on the asset following a previous remediation |
