# Table: `fact_asset_vulnerability_finding_remediation`

**Description:** Accumulating snapshot fact that describes the impact of applying a rollup solution to a vulnerability on an asset. For every rollup solution that is selected for an asset a record will be present in this fact that summaries the result of applying that solution to a vulnerability. Note, this fact does not calculate the impact of solutions that are not the highest level of rollup.


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `asset_id` | `bigint` | The unique identifier of the asset. |
| `vulnerability_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the vulnerability. |
| `solution_id` | `integer` | The unique identifier of the solution. |
| `date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability was first found on the asset. This is the earliest date any instance on the asset was found. |
| `critical_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` | The number of critical vulnerabilities that will be remediated. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is critical, 0 otherwise. |
| `severe_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` |  The number of severe vulnerabilities that will be remediated. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is severe, 0 otherwise. |
| `moderate_vulnerabilities` | `bigint` | The number of moderate vulnerabilities that will be remediated. Either 1 if the vulnerablity finding is moderate, 0 otherwise. |
| `malware_kits` | `integer` | The the count of malware kits associated to the vulnerability that will be remediated. |
| `exploits` | `integer` | The sum of the count of vulnerabilities with exploits on each asset that will be remediated. |
| `vulnerabilities_with_malware_kit` | `integer` | The sum of the count of vulnerabilities with malware on each asset that will be remediated. |
| `vulnerabilities_with_exploit` | `integer` | The sum of the count of vulnerabilities with exploits on each asset that will be remediated. |
| `vulnerability_instances` | `bigint` | The sum of all the vulnerabilities instances on any asset that will be remediated. |
| `raw_risk_score` | `double precision` | The amount of raw risk score that will be reduced by applying the remediation for the vulnerability. |
| `risk_score` | `double precision` | The amount of risk score that will be reduced by applying the remediation for the vulnerability. |
| `pci_failures` | `bigint` | The number of PCI failures that will be resolved by appyling the remediation for the vulnerability. |
| `reintroduced_date` | `timestamp without time zone` | The time at which the vulnerability was first reintroduced on the asset following a previous remediation |
